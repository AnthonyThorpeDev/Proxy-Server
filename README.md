Proxy Server

This is a basic proxy server I am programming to learn about networking.

Usage:

"./proxy <port_number>"

In web browser:

"localhost:<port_number>/URL"

The stages of sending a request from the proxy are visible in the terminal. For example:

1. Request to the proxy:

2. Request that is sent from the proxy server to the remote host (in this case, www.youtube.com):

3. Finally, the response from the remote host:
